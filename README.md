# Apnea detector  
This application recognizes breathing pauses in Wav files, classifying them into Normal or Apnea breathing pauses. 

## Development

It is developed in Java 1.8, using Maven.


- The source code for WavFileInputStream class comes from the library [Java Wav File IO].
- For mocking services in unit tests, I'm using Mockito.
